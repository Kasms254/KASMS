# Frontend (Vite + React + Tailwind + React Router)

This project was scaffolded with Vite and configured to use Tailwind CSS and React Router.

Quick start:

1. Install dependencies

	npm install

2. Start dev server

	npm run dev

3. Build for production

	npm run build

Notes:
- Tailwind is configured in `tailwind.config.cjs` and PostCSS is configured in `postcss.config.cjs`.
- `src/index.css` already contains Tailwind directives (`@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;`).
- React Router is installed and `src/main.jsx` wraps the app in `BrowserRouter` so you can add routes in `src/App.jsx`.

If you want a minimal example route setup, let me know and I can add it.
